                  Achieving deep work should be our goal in any team, but doing
                  it in an office setting can be challenging because of so many
                  distractions. Asynchronous communication in a remote setting
                  is perfect for it. I’m not a fan of long reads with too many
                  unnecessary details, so I’ll “jump” into the subject right
                  away. My guide consists of several parts; thus, you can stop
                  reading at any point when you understand that what you have
                  learned so far covers your needs at the moment, and you can go
                  back/or jump forward to any section when you want to refresh
                  your memory or learn about the more complex workflows. Let’s
                  go and do that!
